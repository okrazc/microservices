### Key Concepts in Spring Security

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - **Authentication**: Verifying who the user is. Spring Security supports several authentication mechanisms like HTTP Basic, OAuth2, and custom authentication providers.
   - **Authorization**: Granting permissions to users based on roles or scopes. It ensures that only authenticated users can access specific resources.

2. **Securing Endpoints**:
   - Securing endpoints in a Spring Boot application typically involves defining access rules for HTTP endpoints using `HttpSecurity` and restricting access based on roles.
   - Common methods include:
     - `hasRole("ROLE_USER")`
     - `hasAuthority("SCOPE_read")`
     - `permitAll()` for public endpoints.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   @Override
   protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
       http
           .authorizeRequests()
               .antMatchers("/public").permitAll()
               .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
               .anyRequest().authenticated()
           .and()
           .formLogin();
   }
   ```

3. **OAuth2 and JWT**:
   - OAuth2 is a protocol for secure, token-based authorization. Spring Security OAuth2 provides integrations with third-party identity providers like Google, GitHub, etc.
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are often used to carry authentication information in a stateless manner.
   - Be familiar with how Spring Security integrates with OAuth2 providers and how to secure APIs using JWT.
   
   Example of securing a REST API with JWT:
   ```java
   @Override
   protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
       http
           .csrf().disable()
           .authorizeRequests()
               .antMatchers("/api/public").permitAll()
               .anyRequest().authenticated()
           .and()
           .oauth2ResourceServer()
               .jwt();
   }
   ```

4. **Method-Level Security**:
   - Spring Security supports method-level security using annotations like `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, and `@PostAuthorize`.
   - This allows you to secure methods in service layers, ensuring users have the appropriate permissions before accessing them.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
   public void adminOnlyFunction() {
       // Admin specific logic
   }
   ```

5. **Custom UserDetailsService**:
   - You can implement a `UserDetailsService` to load user-specific data from a database or other sources. This is useful for defining custom authentication mechanisms.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
       @Override
       public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
           // Fetch user from the database
           return new User("user", "password", Collections.emptyList());
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Password Encoding**:
   - Spring Security supports password encoding through `PasswordEncoder`. Be familiar with how to configure `BCryptPasswordEncoder` to securely store passwords.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   @Bean
   public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
       return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
   }
   ```

7. **Stateless Sessions**:
   - In stateless applications, especially for REST APIs, you may want to disable sessions entirely and rely on token-based authentication (like JWT).
   
   Example:
   ```java
   @Override
   protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
       http
           .csrf().disable()
           .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
           .and()
           .authorizeRequests()
               .antMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()
           .and()
           .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
   }
   ```

### Sample Interview Questions

#### Conceptual Questions:
1. **Explain the difference between authentication and authorization in Spring Security.**
   - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is about granting access to resources based on roles or permissions.

2. **How does Spring Security manage user sessions in a stateless environment like REST APIs?**
   - In a stateless environment, Spring Security can disable sessions (`SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`) and instead use token-based authentication (like JWT) to maintain user identity across requests.

3. **What is the role of `UserDetailsService` in Spring Security, and how would you implement it?**
   - `UserDetailsService` is responsible for loading user-specific data during authentication. It typically loads user information (username, password, roles) from a data source such as a database.

4. **What is CSRF, and when should you disable it in a Spring Boot application?**
   - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts. You should disable CSRF protection when you're building stateless APIs (like with JWT) because it’s irrelevant without sessions.

#### Practical Questions:
5. **How would you secure an endpoint so that only users with the role `ADMIN` can access it?**
   - Use Spring Security’s `HttpSecurity` configuration or method-level security (`@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured`):
     ```java
     .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
     ```

6. **How do you secure a REST API endpoint using OAuth2 and JWT in Spring Security?**
   - Configure Spring Security with `oauth2ResourceServer()` and JWT support:
     ```java
     @Override
     protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
         http
             .csrf().disable()
             .authorizeRequests()
                 .antMatchers("/api/public").permitAll()
                 .anyRequest().authenticated()
             .and()
             .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
     }
     ```

7. **How would you implement role-based authorization at the method level using Spring Security?**
   - You can use `@PreAuthorize` to secure a method based on roles:
     ```java
     @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
     public void adminFunction() {
         // Admin specific logic
     }
     ```

8. **Explain how Spring Security integrates with OAuth2 for single sign-on (SSO) with Google or GitHub.**
   - Spring Security provides `oauth2Login()` to integrate with OAuth2 providers. It handles the redirection flow, token management, and user information fetching.
   Example:
   ```java
   @Override
   protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
       http
           .oauth2Login()
               .loginPage("/login");
   }
   ```

9. **How would you customize the login page for Spring Security?**
   - You can configure a custom login page by calling `formLogin().loginPage("/custom-login")`.
   ```java
   @Override
   protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
       http
           .authorizeRequests()
               .anyRequest().authenticated()
           .and()
           .formLogin().loginPage("/custom-login");
   }
   ```
